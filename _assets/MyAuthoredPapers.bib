  abstract = {In contrast to prevailing knowledge, Ram\textbackslash 'irez Reyes and Yang (2021) showed that tropical cyclones (TCs) can form spontaneously without moisture-radiation and surface-flux feedbacks in a cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulation. Here we ask, why? Fourteen 3D cloud-resolving simulations show that the moisture-entrainment-convection (MEC) feedback can effectively lead to spontaneous TC genesis and intensification in the absence of radiative and surface-flux feedbacks. In the MEC feedback, a moister environment favors new deep convective events that further moisten the environment, leading to aggregation of deep convection. The impact of the MEC feedback on TC genesis and intensification occurs in two distinct time scales: a short time scale set by detrainment moistening the environment (a few hours) and a long time scale (17 days) due to subsidence drying. The hours-long time scale of detrainment suggests that the MEC feedback is an efficient process relevant to TC genesis in the real world.},

  abstract = {Abstract Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most intense and feared storms in the world. What physical processes lead to cyclogenesis remains the most mysterious aspect of TC physics. Here, we study spontaneous TC genesis in rotating radiative\textendash convective equilibrium using cloud-resolving simulations over an f plane with constant sea surface temperature. Previous studies proposed that spontaneous TC genesis requires either radiative or surface-flux feedbacks. To test this hypothesis, we perform mechanism-denial experiments, in which we switch off both feedback processes in numerical simulations. We find that TCs can self-emerge even without radiative and surface-flux feedbacks. Although these feedbacks accelerate the genesis and impact the size of the TCs, TCs in the experiments without them can reach similar intensities as those in the control experiment. We show that TC genesis is associated with an increase in the available potential energy (APE) and that convective heating dominates the APE production. Our result suggests that spontaneous TC genesis may result from a cooperative interaction between convection and circulation and that radiative and surface-flux feedbacks accelerate the process. Furthermore, we find that increasing the planetary rotation favors spontaneous TC genesis.},
